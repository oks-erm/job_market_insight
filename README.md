# Job Market Analysis tool

## Project Goals and Objectives:

The main purpose of the Job Market Analysis project is to provide comprehensive insights and analysis of the job market to aid job seekers, employers, and policymakers in making informed decisions. The project aims to gather and analyze data related to job demand, skills in demand, and salary trends.

* **Skills in Demand:** including analyzing job descriptions, job postings, and employer requirements to determine the key skills and competencies sought after by employers. 

* **Salary Analysis:** researching and collecting data on salary ranges, compensation packages, and benefits offered for different positions. 

* **Regional and Industry-specific Analysis:** identify job market dynamics, regional variations in job demand and salaries, and industry-specific trends. 

The project will produce comprehensive reports, data visualizations, and interactive dashboards.
